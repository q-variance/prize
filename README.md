# Q-Variance Prize — Target Amount $20,000

Can any continuous-time stochastic-volatility model reproduce the exact one-parameter parabolic relationship  
σ(z) = √(σ₀² + z²/2)  
across 200+ assets and all horizons 5–250 days with R² ≥ 0.92 and ≤ 1 free parameter?

Quantum baseline (Orrell 2025): R² ≈ 0.95  
Even frontier AI models currently top out at ~0.88 with 5–10 extra parameters.

Repository contains:
- Full dataset generator (data_loader.py)
- Scoring engine
- Live leaderboard
- Baseline quantum fit

AI and machine-learning entries explicitly encouraged.

Launching January 2026 — details soon.
